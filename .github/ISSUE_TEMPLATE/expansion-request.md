Please send the full output of the `/clx version` command in your console.

**Which plugin needs a compatibility expansion?**
Some plugins already have expansions, such as WorldGuard.
Please send a link to the plugin's main page and a link to their API page.
Expansions for premium plugins without an API cannot be created.

**Why do you need us to create an expansion?**
In other words, have you asked the original developer to add support?
